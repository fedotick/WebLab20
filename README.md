Repositories with solved tasks.

## Tasks

1. Given an input field (an input element). Next to it, there is a "+" button. Upon clicking this button, another empty input should appear below our input.

2. The web page contains an ordered list `ol` and a button. Upon clicking the button, retrieve its last child and remove it.

3. The web page contains an ordered list `ol` and a button. Upon clicking the button, a new list item `li` with the text 'item' should be added to the end of the list.

4. The web page contains an unordered list `ul`. Given an array (the elements of the array can be entered via prompt separated by spaces or commas). Insert the elements of this array at the end of the `ul` so that each element is in its own `li`. (To do this, create an "Add" button)

5. Given an array (the elements of the array can be entered via prompt separated by spaces or commas). Create a `div` using createElement, then insert each element of this array into a separate `p` inside this `div`, then insert this `div` at the end of the `body`.
